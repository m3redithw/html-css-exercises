# HTML CSS Exercises

## Introduction
### What is CSS?
- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
- CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
- External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

### CSS Solved a Big Problem
- HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!

- HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:

  - `<h1>This is a heading</h1>`

  - `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>`

- When tags like <font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.

- To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.

- CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!

### CSS Savs a Lot of Work!
- The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.

- With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

## CSS Syntax
A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.

- `p` is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style: <p>).
- `color` is a property, and `red` is the property value
- `text-align` is a property, and `center` is the property value

## CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

- Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
- Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
- Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
- Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
- Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
